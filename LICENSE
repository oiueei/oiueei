Terms

The Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative
works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work. The
Licensor may make an Additional Use Grant, above, permitting limited
production use.

Effective on the Change Date, or the fourth anniversary of the first publicly
available distribution of a specific version of the Licensed Work under this
Licence, whichever comes first, the Licensor hereby grants you rights under
the terms of the Change License, and the rights granted in the paragraph
above terminate.

If your use of the Licensed Work does not comply with the requirements
currently in effect as described in this Licence, you must purchase a
commercial licence from the Licensor, its affiliated entities, or authorised
resellers, or you must refrain from using the Licensed Work.

All copies of the original and modified Licensed Work, and derivative works
of the Licensed Work, are subject to this Licence. This Licence applies
separately for each version of the Licensed Work and the Change Date may vary
for each version of the Licensed Work released by Licensor.

You must conspicuously display this Licence on each original or modified copy
of the Licensed Work. If you receive the Licensed Work in original or
modified form from a third party, the terms and conditions set forth in this
Licence apply to your use of that work.

Any use of the Licensed Work in violation of this Licence will automatically
terminate your rights under this Licence for the current and all other
versions of the Licensed Work.

This Licence does not grant you any right in any trademark or logo of
Licensor or its affiliates (provided that you may use a trademark or logo of

   or a licence that is compatible with GPL Version 2.0 or a later version,
   where "compatible" means that software provided under the Change Licence can

   later version. Licensor may specify additional Change Licences without
   limitation.

2. To either: (a) specify an Additional Use Grant that does not impose any
